# ☕ Java Learning Repository

This repository contains my **Java learning journey**, where I practiced and implemented various **core and advanced Java concepts** through small projects and hands-on exercises.  
Each folder focuses on a specific topic or concept in Java — from OOP fundamentals to advanced multithreading and real-world mini-projects.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Core Java Concepts
Covers the fundamental building blocks of Java, including syntax, data types, operators, and control structures.

### 🔹 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Demonstrates the principles of **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction** with practical examples.

### 🔹 Modifiers & Access Control
Explores different **access modifiers** (public, private, protected, default) and how they control the visibility of classes and members.

### 🔹 Exception Handling
Shows how to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try-catch-finally`, custom exceptions, and best practices for error management.

### 🔹 Collections
Includes examples of **Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Map)** to efficiently manage and organize groups of objects.  
It also demonstrates how various collection types work internally and when to use each structure.

### 🔹 Generics
Explains how **Generics** enable type safety and code reusability by allowing classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on different data types without losing compile-time checks.  
This section shows how to create **generic classes and methods**, use **wildcards**, and understand **bounded type parameters**, which make code more flexible and less error-prone.

### 🔹 Multithreading
Covers **thread creation, synchronization, and concurrency management**, demonstrating how Java handles parallel execution.

### 🔹 Interface & Abstraction
Illustrates how interfaces and abstract classes are used to design flexible and loosely-coupled code.

## 🚆 Mini Projects

### 🔸 Aadhaar_Pan_Project
A small project demonstrating **data validation and mapping** logic in Java.

### 🔸 FindMyTrainProject
A console-based project simulating a simple **train management or search system**, reinforcing object interaction and data management concepts.
